			longCopy: `A complete design and development project. Team Ted Tile is a Bay Area tilesetting business who needed a website to show off their amazing work. I really just wanted to get the photos front and center asap. So then the most important thing technically was to make sure the loading time was as small as possible and managed throughout. After all, it being such an image heavy site, it has the potential to be a loader curmudgeon. So I really explored techniques to get image loading in the background.

I also spent time on the slideshow on this project. Slideshows tend to live somewhere in most projects I do, so over time I've been zeroing in on my perfect implementation of one. (I tend to avoid plug-ins in favor of diy, except when I don't). Anyway this one turned out really well. I got it most of the way there and then ended up following a tutorial by a squarespace guy for the sweet mobile slide action.

Finally, this site is also built in a truly progressively enhanced way. Go ahead, turn off javascript, it'll still work fine! It just uses a bunch of, you know, going back and forth to the server, old school style. It's built using simple technologies, other than the html5 languages themselves, just jQuery really.`,

Then I supported campaigns with landing pages and I produced the weekly 'fare' sale. The bottom line with all of it being, of course, to take care of the awesome brand that is (soon to be was!, maybe, so sad.) Virgin America.

The real project of my work with Virgin was helping move them from their v2.0 website to their v3.0, as we were calling it. I lead the content port both to the newly designed look, as well as into a newly implemented cms. We moved from posting files on an ftp server, to a cms that fed data into an Angular front end.`,

Coming at web development from the visual side I never, say, wrote many algorithms, so this is a great opportunity to do some of that sort of thing and then a lot more. My favorite thing about it is that anyone could use it, and it's really good. Anyway, I'm so glad I found it.

Here are embeds or links to most of the projects I've made so far:

"Pomodoro Clock", to make sure you don't take too many facebook breaks. I also think it works in the other direction too, so you don't get absorbed in a challenge and forget to stretch your shoulders for 6 hours. So anyway, it's a work-break timer thing. I worked on a UI that reflected that we are looking at the *relationship* between work periods and break periods

#### Api builds  
Built with Node.js and Express. These are on heroku on their sandbox servers, so they take a moment to "Wake up". That's a good exercise of course, in using all public servers instead of setting up from a linux box like I usually do. Scaling and whatnot.

Of course it wasn't limited to only the capturing of the photos but to the whole workflows to get images generated efficiently. There was even a funny quirk in the architecture of our mock store space that had me photoshopping walls`,

This is a collaboration with another Graphic Artist, I did the animations. These lived on facebook and were meant to highlight some fun stuff happening each month at Old Navy. It was kind of a random project that didn't last too long but it was really fun to do. I got to put all my studies of the particle generator in After Effects to use to make the BBQ smoke and explode.

These videos are for social media and were for supporting an Old Navy initiative called Studio Spotlight that was an internal designer's personal line produced for select stores by ON. So we made videos to introduce the designers. These are a couple of my favorites, we made four total.
