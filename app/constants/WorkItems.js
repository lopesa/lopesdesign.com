			longCopy: `A complete design and development project. Team Ted Tile is a Bay Area tilesetting business who needed a website to show off their amazing work. Their needs were simply these: convey a sense of Ted's amazing work via photography and give interested viewers a way to get in touch to start the conversation about their project. With straightforward visual goals, the most important thing technically was to make sure the loading time was as small as possible and managed throughout. After all, it being such an image heavy site, it has the potential to be a loader curmudgeon. So I really got into image loading technique on this one. Every image's download timing is considered, and designed to be as transparent to the user as possible, and we're conscious to give the user something to be feasting their eyes on while more visuals get delivered. Ted's work is the star and holds attention well.

I also spent time on the slideshow on this project. Slideshows tend to live somewhere in most projects I do, so over time I've been zeroing in on my perfect implementation of one. (I tend to avoid plug-ins in favor of diy, and I've been d'ing my y (o) slideshow for a while now). Anyway this one turned out really well. I got it most of the way there and then ended up following a tutorial by a squarespace guy for the sweet mobile slide action.

Finally, this site is also built in a truly progressively enhanced way. Go ahead, turn off javascript, it'll still work fine! It just uses a bunch of, you know, going back and forth to the server, old school style. It's built using simple technologies, other than languages themselves, just jQuery really.`,

			longCopy: `Enterprise web work. I worked for two years at Virgin America as the marketing department web developer. The work encompassed digital marketing, email, and web production, design and development, all wrapped up in different ways at different times. The bottom line of course being to take care of the awesome brand that is Virgin America.

My time with VX also encompassed the complete revision of the website for which I served as the producer of the change for all things content related (as differentiated from the ticket booking 'machine').`,

			longCopy: `Free Code Camp is an outstanding resource that I've been using to solidify much of my core javascript knowledge, as well as to build that knowledge out. Coming at web development from the visual side I never, say, wrote many algorithms. So this has been a great chance to take a step back and do much of that sort of thing.

#### [Algorithms](https://github.com/lopesa/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/algorithms.js)

#### Front End Projects  
Calculator  
Pomodoro Clock  
"Random" quote generator (which I include mostly because I found a pretty hilarious bunch of programmers' code comments)

#### React.js Projects
Markdown Translator  
Free Code Camp brownie points leader board (api consumption)

#### Apis  
Built with Node.js and Express. These are on heroku on their sandbox servers, so they take a moment to "Wake up". They are a good exercise though, in using all public servers instead of setting up from a linux box like I usually do.
